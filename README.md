## Introduction
A non existing user will be able to visit the website, view the home page, view the products and their prices and register. Exisitng users will be able to log in and view the products with the option of inputing a quantity and also a button for add to cart displayed. Exisitng users will alos be able to see any orders that are saved in the database.
There is also an admin log in section. The admin users control the edit,delete and add for coffees. They also manage users and add,delete and edit user types.

## Improvements
There was some features which I would have wished to implement if I had more time:
1. Get cart working through ajax
2. Making the site look more attractive to a user
3. Confirm on delete/edit for more security for admin users
4. Error messages for the forms could be improved
5. Use more images and more bootstrap
